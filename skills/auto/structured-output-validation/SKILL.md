name: structured-output-validation
description: Use when producing structured data/log outputs that must match a specified schema, units, or file layout.
---
- Enumerate every required output file and every required field before parsing input.
- Parse and normalize inputs once, then reuse the same cleaned data for all answers and outputs.
- Write final artifacts to the expected workspace location, not only to scratch directories.
- Validate by loading each output with the same parser a grader would use.
- Check existence, schema, field types, units, counts, distinctness, sorting, and canonical spellings.
- Convert all timestamps to UTC and emit them in the required string format.
- Emit money values in the required unit, such as integer cents, consistently in every file.
- Include the required metadata/provenance block exactly; omit extra fields if they violate the schema.
- Reconcile summary answers with the detailed output rows so they cannot contradict each other.
- Before finishing, run an independent validation script over the written files.
- Do not treat a chat summary as a deliverable; the files are the deliverable.
